## Question 1

Briefly describe the FIFO page-replacement algorithm and analyze its algorithm complexity

## Question 2

Briefly describe the MIN page-replacement algorithm and analyze its algorithm complexity.

MIN page-replacement algorithm is a ideal algorithm that needs future information of page required.

In this lab, we can only use an offline approach to implement the algorithm.

Behavior:

## Question 3

Briefly describe the LRU page-replacement algorithm and analyze its algorithm complexity

## Question 4

Briefly describe the clock algorithm and analyze its algorithm complexity

## Question 5

Briefly describe the second-chance algorithm and analyze its algorithm complexity
